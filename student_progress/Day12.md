# Final Testing and API Validation
  #### Today, I performed final testing of all APIs and validated the models and relationships to ensure everything was working as expected.

### Tasks:
* Used Postman to test the APIs for creating, updating, and listing students, teachers, departments, and schools.
* Ensured the performance calculations for teachers were accurate.
* Validated that the HOD assignment was functioning correctly.
